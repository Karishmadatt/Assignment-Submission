1. What exactly is []?

ans: This the list. We represent the list by[].

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the
   third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)

ans: spam[2]="hello"

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.

3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?

ans: spam=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']  
     int('3' * 2)=33
     int('3' * 2) / 11 = 3.0
     int(int('3' * 2) / 11) = 3
     spam[3] = 'd'
     o/p will be d

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?

ans: d

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?

ans: c

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?

ans: 1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?

ans: 99 will append at the 5th index or at the last.
    o/p will be:
    3.14
    cat
    11
    cat
    True
    99

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?

ans: This the remove the value if 3rd index 'cat'
     o/p will be:
     3.14
     11
     cat
     True

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?

ans: The operator for concatenation is '+'
     The operator for replication is '*'

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?

ans: append() will add the element at the last of the list. 
     insert() can add the element anywhere in the list.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?

ans: remove() and the del statement.

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.

ans:Both have the indexes and slices.
    Both can use len().
    Both can be append ,replicated.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?

ans:Tuples is written in parenthesis().
    list is written in square bracket[].
    list is mutable while tuples are immutable.

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?

ans:(42,)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?

ans:bacon=[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]  print(tuple(bacon))
    bacon=(3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True)  print(list(bacon))

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
    contain?

ans: They contain the reference.

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

ans:copy.deepcopy() will make the duplicate list inside the list and copy.copy will simply copy the list.
