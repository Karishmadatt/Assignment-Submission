1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

ans: True and False 
     eg. a=1 and b=0
        print(a==b)
        o/p: False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

ans: The three basic Boolean types operators are AND ,  OR and NOT.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
   values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

ans:  For AND                       For OR                For NOT 
     
      a   b   a AND b          a   b   a OR b            a   a NOT
      0   0    0               0   0     0               0    1   
      0   1    0               0   1     1               0    0     
      1   0    0               1   0     1
      1   1    1               1   1     1

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
   (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
   not (5 > 4)
   (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
   not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
   (True and True) and (True == False)
   (not False) or (not True)

ans:  (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  o/p will be False.
      not (5 > 4)           o/p will be False.
      (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)   o/p will be True.
      not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))   o/p will be False.
      (True and True) and (True == False)   o/p will be False.
      (not False) or (not True)    o/p will be True.

5. What are the six comparison operators?

ans: 1.Less Than (<) operator.
     2.Greater Than (>) operator.
     3.Less Than or Equal To (<=) operator.
     4.Equal To or Greater Than (>=) operator.
     5.Equal To (==) operator.
     6.Not Equal Operator (!=) operator.

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
   condition and when you would use one.

ans: The assignment operator (=) is use to assign the value from right variable to left one.
     The equal to operator(==) is use to check whether two variable is equal or not. 
     eg. The assignment operator(=)
          a=10
          The equal to operator(==) 
          True == False.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
   spam = 0
   if spam == 10:
   print('eggs')
   if spam > 5:
   print('bacon')
   else:
   print('ham')
   print('spam')
   print('spam')

ans: 1.if spam == 10:
       print('eggs')
     2.if spam > 5:
       print('bacon')
     3.else:
       print('ham')
       print('spam')
       print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
   Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

ans:
 spam = int(input())
if spam==1:
    print('Hello')
if spam==2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?

ans:Ctrl + C

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

ans: The break statement in Python terminates the current loop and resumes execution at the next statement.
   for letter in 'English':     
      if letter == 'i':
         break
      print ('Current Letter :', letter)

      o/p
   Current Letter : E
   Current Letter : n
   Current Letter : g
   Current Letter : l

     The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.
     for letter in 'English':    
       if letter == 'i':
         continue
       print ('Current Letter :', letter)

       o/p
    Current Letter : E
    Current Letter : n
    Current Letter : g
    Current Letter : l
    Current Letter : s
    Current Letter : h

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

ans: When user call range() with one argument, user will get a series of numbers that starts at 0 and includes every whole number up to, 
     but not including, the number that user have provided as the stop. for range(10) the series of number starts at 0 and end to 9 , it exclude 10.

     When user call range() with two arguments, user get to decide not only where the series of numbers stops but also where it starts, 
     so user don’t have to start at 0 all the time. User can use range() to generate a series of numbers from X to Y using a range(X, Y). 
     for range(0,10) the series of number starts at 0 and end to 9 , it exclude 10.

     When user call range() with three arguments, user can choose not only where the series of numbers will start and stop
     but also how big the difference will be between one number and the next.
     If user don’t provide a step, then range() will automatically behave as if the step is 1.
     for range(0,10,1) the series of number starts at 0 and end to 9 , it exclude 10 by incrementing the step by one.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
    program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

ans: Using for loop
    for i in range (1,11,1):
        print(i)
    
    Using while loop
    i = 1
    while i < 11:
      print(i)
      i += 1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
    importing spam?

ans: from spam import bacon   
     bacon()
